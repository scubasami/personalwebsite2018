<p>A good Cybersecurity tip would be to have a password manager.  This way, when you log into things you have a secure password that won't be hacked very easily if someone ends up with your 
email or username.  Also, a password manager prevents you from losing information in other places if something else you had your information on got hacked.  You would be vulnerable to that example
if you used the same password for everything.  So, make sure to look into using a password manager. </p>
